h1. rah_autogrowing_textarea

p. Automatically expanding textareas for "Textpattern CMS's":http://textpattern.com backend. The plugin makes so that all admin-side textareas are adjusted to automatically grow along the content. While you type, the textarea will follow and resize, depending on the amount of the content and lines.

h2. Requirements

p. Rah_autogrowing_textarea's minumum requirements:

* Textpattern v4.2.0 and newer.
* PHP 5.2 and newer.

p. Rah_autogrowing_textarea supports the following web browsers:

* Firefox 12 and newer.
* Internet Explorer 9 and newer.
* Safari 5.1 and newer.
* Chrome 9 and newer.
* Opera 12 and newer.

h2. Installing

p. Rah_autogrowing_textarea's installation follows the standard plugin installation steps.

# Download the plugin installation code.
# Copy and paste the installation code into the _Install plugin_ box of your Textpattern Plugin pane.
# Run the automated setup.
# After the setup is done, activate the plugin. Done.

p. All admin-side textareas are should now automatically expand with the content.

h2. For developers

p. Rah_autogrowing_textarea allows admin-side themes and plugins to set rules for the expanding textareas. Themes have the ability to limit the fields dimensions or disable the plugin on a field basis. All this is doable with some basic, general CSS rules.

h3. CSS and field sizes

p. A field's starting height is decided by a visual size set with CSS, or the actual height of the element if no CSS height is specified. The starting size used in an empty state can be set with the "height":https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/height CSS property.

p. A field's maximum height when expanded can be set with a "max-height":https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/max-height CSS property. If a "textarea":https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/textarea doesn't have max-height it expands automatically all the way up to 99999 pixels.

p. Consider the following CSS:

bc. textarea#abc_fieldName {
	max-height: 5em;
	height: 1em;
}

p. With the above, the textarea with the id @abc_fieldName@ will not get any smaller than @1em@ or bigger than @5em@.

h3. Disabling for a field

p. Automatic expanding can be disabled on a field basis. Any textarea element that is armed with a class @rah_autogrowing_textarea_disable@ will not be affected by the plugin.

bc. <textarea class="rah_autogrowing_textarea_disable" name="foo" rows="10">
	I don't grow.
</textarea>

p. A field's expanding can also be disabled by setting the element's CSS property @max-height@ to a equal or a lower value than the @height@.

h3. Attaching to a textarea

p. The plugin works for textareas present in the initial page load. If the DOM modified after that and a new textarea is added, the the plugin's resizer needs to be attached to those elements. The plugin allows using a jQuery interface. It has a method named @rah_autogrowing_textarea_resize()@.

bc. $('textarea').rah_autogrowing_textarea_resize();

p. The above would attach the resizing magic to any new textarea present on the page.

h3. Triggering resize

p. A textarea's resizing can be invoked manually incase the field's contents are changed programmatically on-the-fly. These type of automated changes are not otherwise tracked without the plugin being specifically informed about the change. Rah_autogrowing_textarea has a custom event named as @rah_autogrowing_textarea_resize@. You can access it using jQuery's "trigger":http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ method.

bc. $('textarea').trigger('rah_autogrowing_textarea_resize');
